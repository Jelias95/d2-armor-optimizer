D2 Armor Optimizer is a command line tool for trying to identify optimal armor builds in Destiny 2.

It is still in alpha - the goal is to create a system that will get you as close to 3 100s as possible for your preferred stats. Right now it's better at returning 2 than it is 3. As input, it takes the armor spreadsheet you can export from Destiny Item Manager (DIM).

Goals:

-   Better distribution between 3 stats
-   Cap stats at 90 (since it uses base stats and masterworking will take you to 100)
-   Flesh out the ability to build around an exotic armor piece
-   Put it in a docker container
-   Craft a font-end

To use:

1. Clone repo
2. npm install
3. npm run start
